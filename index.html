                        Hi, my name is Sunisa Hewitt and this my portfolio. You'll be able to see some work I've done in the past and witness some neat things I've done. 
                        I'm currently a second year student at University of North Texas, while I finish this UT bootcamp since I am trying to better my life. The craziest 
                        thing I have experienced so far this year, is me almost dating a QAnon man, who was also a flat-earther. As well as that he did not believe that 
                        our solar system was real. And he thought everything was fake by the satanists running the American government. I met him at the Chili's To-Go parking lot.
